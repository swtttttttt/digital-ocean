                            <p>Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 â€“ April 21, 2016) was an 
                                American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. 
                                Widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his 
                                generation, he was known for his flamboyant, 
                                androgynous persona and wide vocal range, which 
                                included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams. 
                                Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound. 
                                His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, 
                                R&B, rock, new wave, soul, synth-pop, pop, jazz, and hip hop. 
                                He often played most or all instruments on his recordings.

                            <p>Born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
                                Prince signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. 
                                Records at the age of 19, and released the albums For 
                                You (1978) and Prince (1979). 
                                He went on to achieve critical success with the innovative 
                                albums Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 
                                1999 (1982). His sixth album, Purple Rain (1984), 
                                was recorded with his backup band the Revolution, and 
                                was the soundtrack to his film acting debut of the same 
                                name. Purple Rain spent six consecutive months atop the 
                                Billboard 200.

                        <p> In the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros. in 1993, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol Logo. Hollow circle above downward arrow crossed with a curlicued horn-shaped symbol and then a short bar (known to fans as the "Love Symbol"), and was sometimes referred to as the Artist Formerly Known as Prince or TAFKAP, or simply the Artist. He signed with Arista Records in 1998 and began referring to himself by his own name again in 2000. After returning to mainstream prominence following a performance at the Grammy Awards ceremony in 2004, he scored six US top ten albums over the following decade. In mid-life, Prince reportedly experienced considerable pain from injuries to his body (mainly hips) sustained through his dynamic stage performances (which included leaping off speaker stacks in high heels), and was sometimes seen using a cane. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota.</p>

                        <p> Prince had a prolific output, releasing 39 albums during his life, with a vast array of unreleased projects left in a vault at his home after his death. It is believed that the vault contains dozens of fully produced albums and over 50 music videos that have never been released, along with various other media.</p>
